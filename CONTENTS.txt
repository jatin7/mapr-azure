The files in this repo support the templatized deployment of a 
MapR cluster within Azure. 

Summary:
	At the top level, the azuredeploy.json (or az_scripte.json) 
	template is selected, and a set of parameters provided 
	(aligning with the azuredeploy-parameters.json file).
		NOTE: Multiple other json files are "included" in the
		template, but other than the bootstrap*json files, there
		is little need to change any of them.


azuredeploy.json :
bootstrap.json :
installer-wrapper.sh :
	Azure template for MapR installation driven by MapR Installer service.

az_scripted.json :
bootstrap_scripted.json :
azure-wrapper.sh :
	Azure template for scripted installation (see the deploy-mapr*.sh scripts).
		NOTE: This framework is best supported by a WASB copy of
		the github repo as the artifactsBaseUrl rather than the 
		public github repo itself.   We have seen many problems with
		download failures from https://raw.githubusercontent.com
		when multiple nodes are spun up in parallel

<instance_type>*.json :
	Clones of the different instance configuration details.   The
	goal is to mazimize the storage capacity of each node (2 virtual
	disk spindles per virtual core).

mainTemplate.json :
createUiDefinition.json :
	Support for Azure Marketplace.   mainTemplate is simply  a clone
	of azuredeploy.json or az_scripted.json ... with the following
	changes :
		- remove default for "artifactsBaseUrl"
		- remove default and allowedValues for "location" parameter
		- remove default for "maprPassword" 
		- set default for "sshKey" and "adminPassword" to "" 
			(required because the GUI won't pass both in to template).
		- adjust default and allowedValues for "vmSize" if you
			need to constrain the set of supported VM's
